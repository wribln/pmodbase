    <p class="lead">The Present-Comment Process (PCP) reflects processes in a project environment
      where one project group presents work results (documents, drawings, site conditions), and another
      project group records observations and makes comments on this work result.</p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Present-Comment Process (PCP) is represented using the following model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param 'PCP Categories' -%> reflect an agreement between two project parties to
        perform a Present-Comment Process. For example, the review of Civil Works drawings by the
        Systems Engineering Group is such an agreement between the Civil Works group and the 
        Systems group. Statistics on the status of the all subjects in each PCP Category can be
        produced at any time. In addition, hashtags can be used to further define sub-categories
        for statistics; for example, the status of Civil Works drawings can be reported on a
        location by location basis by using location-specific hashtags.</li>
      <li><%= help_param 'PCP Subjects' -%> are items on which the Present-Comment Process is
        performed: a PCP Subject could be single document, an individual drawing, or a punch
        list for a specific site.<br/>
        While in the Present-Comment Process, a PCP Subject will be handled by either the
        Presenting Group, or by the Commenting Group. The handing-over from one group to the
        other is a 'Release'. Initially, the Presenting Group will release the PCP Subject to
        the Commenting Group. The Commenting Group will then report their observations and
        an overall assessment of the PCP Subject.<br/>
        In the next step, the Commenting Group will release the PCP Subject (back) to the
        Presenting Group. The Presenting Group can now respond to the observations by 
        commenting on each and every observation. Once this step is completed, the PCP Subject
        is released again to the Commenting Group. With documents or drawings, this step 
        normally involves the submission of a new revision of the document or drawing.</li>
      <li>Each of the above steps is called <%= help_param 'PCP Step'-%>. The first
        step would be the <%= help_term PcpStep::STEP_LABELS[ 0 ]-%>, the second 
        <%= help_term PcpStep::STEP_LABELS[ 1 ]-%>, the third
        <%= help_term PcpStep::STEP_LABELS[ 2 ]-%>, and so on.<br/>
        The transition from one PCP Step to the next PCP Step is performed by a formal
        <%= help_param 'Release' -%>. This action includes the preparation of a 'Release'
        document containing the current status of the PCP Subject and including all current
        (and public) observations and comments.</li>
      <li>Observations and comments on a PCP Subject are collected on a <%= help_param 'PCP Item'-%>
        basis: Each single observation is added to a PCP Subject as an individual PCP Item with a
        reference to the specific location of the issue (e.g. chapter, page, area). An initial
        assessment of the issue becomes the basis for the initial overall assessment of the PCP
        Subject.<br/>
        In subsequent PCP Steps, comments can be added to PCP Items as response to the original 
        observation. These comments can be public or non-public/internal. Public comments will
        become visible by anyone once the respective PCP Step is released. Non-public/internal
        comments are only visible to the originating group (Presenting or Commenting Group).<br/>
        Before a PCP Subject can be released, at least one public comment must be made for each
        and every PCP Item as a response to the current PCP Step.</li>
      <li>Public PCP Items and Comments can be viewed when they are released. Adding comments
        and subsequently responses are only allowed by the owner and the deputy for the PCP
        Subject as well as for the specified <%= help_param 'PCP Participants'-%>. These are
        users administered by the owner or the deputy of the PCP Subject.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Roles for PCP Categories</h3>
    <p>The PCP Categories are administered by one or more persons with specific access rights. PCP
    Categories are created based on a specific agreement (explicit or implicit by the project
    environment) between two project groups. Hence, changes to any attributes would be a change
    to that agreement.</p>
    <p>Each party is expected to name a representative and a deputy. These two persons would be entered
    as Owner and Deputy for their respective groups (PCP Category attributes
    <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )-%> and
    <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_deputy_id )-%>, and as 
    <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_owner_id )-%> and
    <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_deputy_id )-%> respectively).</p>
    <p>In order to create PCP Subjects of a given PCP Category, a user must have permission to create
      and update PCP Subjects for the <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%>. You can later change the group assignment only if you have also the permission to create and
      update PCP Subjects for the new project group.</p>
    <p>If, for example, a PCP Category is set up for the review of systems documents, the
      <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%> could be set to a general
      project group (such as 'SYS' - for 'Systems Engineering'). Without further permissions, only
      users in the 'SYS' group would be permitted to add PCP Subjects for this PCP Category. If
      other system groups should be allowed to add PCP Subjects for this PCP Category, they would
      require the permission to create PCP Subjects for the 'SYS' group in addition to the
      permission to add and modify PCP Subjects for their own group. In any case, the 
      <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )-%> would be set to the creator
      of the new PCP Subject.</p>
    <p>Users which are responsible for the administration of PCP Categories need the add and edit
    access rights for the feature
    <%= help_term Feature.find_by_id( FEATURE_ID_PCP_CATEGORIES ).label_with_id-%>.</p>
    <h3>Roles for PCP Subjects</h3>
    <p>Each PCP Subject has at least two owners, optionally also a respective deputy:
      <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )-%> and
      <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_deputy_id )-%>, and 
      <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_owner_id )-%> and
      <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_deputy_id )-%> respectively.</p>
    <p>An owner (or her deputy) must have edit access permissions for the feature
      <%= help_term Feature.find_by_id( FEATURE_ID_PCP_SUBJECTS ).label_with_id-%> in order
      to be able to view and/or modify PCP Subject attributes and to perform a Release.</p>
    <p>A user must have the add and edit access permissions for the feature
      <%= help_term Feature.find_by_id( FEATURE_ID_PCP_CATEGORIES ).label_with_id-%> 
      and the <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%> in order
      to create new PCP Subjects. She can later change this group if she also has these
      access permissions for the new group.</p>
    <p>Also, PCP owners and deputies should have access permissions for the feature
      <%= help_term Feature.find_by_id( FEATURE_ID_PCP_MEMBERS ).label_with_id-%> in order
      to add PCP Participants to their respective PCP Group.</p>
    <h3>Roles for PCP Items</h3>
    <p>An owner or deputy may also assign other users as participants of the Present-Comment
    Process for her PCP Subject. These users may require add and edit permissions for the
    feature <%= help_term Feature.find_by_id( FEATURE_ID_PCP_ITEMS ).label_with_id-%> in
    order to add and edit observations and/or comments.</p>
    <p>PCP Participants of the Presenting Group may comment on PCP Items;
    PCP Participants of the Commenting Group may make create observations (PCP Items),
    or add comments to existing items.</p>
    <p>All observations are public by default and can be viewed by anyone as soon as the
    respective PCP Step is released.</p>
    <p>All comments are created non-public/internal and can be viewed only by the
    PCP Subject participants. Only a PCP Subject owner or deputy (for his respective
    group) can make flag a comment as public or create a public comment. Once a PCP
    Step is released, the comments marked as public can be viewed by anyone.</p>
    <h3>Principles of Reporting</h3>
    <p>Generally, only the status at the most-recent release will be shown. However,
    the detailed status of a specific PCP Subject will be visible to the participants
    of the currently responsible group (owner, deputy and any other user). This
    ensures that the current work-status is restricted to those actually working on
    the PCP Subject.</p>
