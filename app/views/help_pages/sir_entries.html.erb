    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>A SIR Log Entry is often shown as part of a SIR Log Item together with all other
    SIR Log Entries belonging to that SIR Log Item. Only when requesting a detailed
    view to modify this Entry, a form is shown with the attributes specific for this
    individual SIR Log Entry.</p>
    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param SirEntry.human_attribute_name( :type )%> determines what type of
      SIR Log Entry this is:
      <ul>
        <li><%= help_term SirEntry::SIR_ENTRY_REC_TYPE_LABELS[ 0 ]%> is a SIR Log Entry
        which designates a forwarding post, i.e. a comment or request for action is 
        passed from the current, the <%= help_param t( 'sir_entries.form.from_group' )%> to another project group, the
        <%= help_param t( 'sir_entries.form.to_group' )%>. rom now on, the new group will
        be responsible for this SIR Log Entry.</li>
        <li><%= help_term SirEntry::SIR_ENTRY_REC_TYPE_LABELS[ 1 ]%> is a comment from one group, the
        <%= help_param t( 'sir_entries.form.c_by_group' )%>. If another group is specified as 
        <%= help_param t( 'sir_entries.form.c_to_group' )%>, then the other group can also view this
        comment; otherwise, the comment is only visible to the commenting group.</li>
        <li><%= help_term SirEntry::SIR_ENTRY_REC_TYPE_LABELS[ 2 ]%> causes the issue
        to be returned from the <%= help_param t( 'sir_entries.form.from_group' )%>
        to the previous group (<%= help_param t( 'sir_entries.form.to_group' )%> 
        as a response to the original forward request. The previous group is now
        responsible for this SIR Log Item again.</li>
      </ul>    
      </li>
      <li><%= help_param SirEntry.human_attribute_name( :due_date )%> can be set when
      forwarding a comment or request for action to another group. It indicates to the 
      newly responsible group that a reply is expected until the given date.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SirEntry.human_attribute_name( :description )%> is a field to
      contain the text of the comment, request or response.</li>
