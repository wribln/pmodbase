    <p>This table is used only to provide labels for the various file types. File types are
      recognized by the file's extension. The label is used in the display of CFR records
      for information and to enable searching through files in the CFR by type of file (regardsless
      of the specific extension).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param CfrFileType.human_attribute_name( :label )-%> is the label for the
        given file extension. This attribute is required.</li>
      <li><%= help_param CfrFileType.human_attribute_name( :extensions ) -%> should be a comma-separated
        list of file extensions to be associated with the above label. Note: This feature
        does not perform extensive syntax checking on the string being input; it expects a list
        of strings separated by a comma, blanks will be removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>You can use a folder-type CFR record without any extensions as a collector for specific files. Each
    file in that 'folder' can belong to several 'folders'. And you can specify 'folders' of 'folders'...</p>
