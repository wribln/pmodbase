    <p class="lead">Manage Interface Agreements within the ISR</p>
    <p>Interface Agreements (IAs) document and track the exchange of information and other
      deliverables between the contracting parties in a project. Each IA is related to a
      specific interface. There can be one or more IA for any given interface as an interface
      may involve one or more project groups to resolve it.</p>
    <p>IAs result in the exchange of project information generated by one party that is needed
      by another party to continue with its scheduled project tasks. This project information
      could be delivered in the form of engineering drawings, specifications, design reports
      and calculations, equipment details, project schedule information, etc.</p>
    <p>A single IA should serve a very specific purpose as documented in the IA definition.
      This purpose should be independent from any other IA.</p>
    <p>The main part of an interface agreement is the interface definition, i.e. a general
      description of who should provide what information to whom by when. Further details
      and specific dates will be traced by IA-specific action items.</p>
    <p>IAs can be changed or terminated upon request by either party. A change of an IA
      should be considered if only minor changes (in the interface description or in an
      attached document, or in an involved party) are to be made. If the changes require
      major rework, different activities and deadlines, the current IA should be terminated
      and replaced by a new IA with new resolution and validation steps.</p>
