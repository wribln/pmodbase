    <p class="lead">Manage Interface Agreements within the ISR</p>
    <p>This help text contains information on the handling of the <strong>Interface Agreement</strong> (IA)
    information within the ISR. Information on the top-level <strong>Interface</strong> (IF) attributes can be
    found <%= link_to_help :isr_interfaces, 'here' %>; for a general introduction about the 
    Interface Status Register (ISR) see <%= link_to_help :isr_general, 'here' %>.
    <h3>Interface Agreements (IAs)</h3>
    <p>Interface Agreements (IAs) document and track the exchange of information and other
      deliverables between the contracting parties in a project. Each IA is related to a
      specific Interface (IF). There can be one or more IA for any given IF as an IF may
      involve one or more project groups to resolve it.</p>
    <p>IAs result in the exchange of project information generated by one party that is needed
      by another party to continue with its scheduled project tasks. This project information
      could be delivered in the form of engineering drawings, specifications, design reports
      and calculations, equipment details, project schedule information, etc.</p>
    <p>A single IA should serve a very specific purpose as documented in the IA definition.
      This purpose should be independent from any other IA.</p>
    <p>The main part of an IA is the interface definition, i.e. a general
      description of who should provide what information to whom by when. Further details
      and specific dates will be traced by IA-specific action items, initially as 
      'Resolution Steps'. If required, action items for 'Validation Steps' can be defined
      in a separate action item list.</p>
    <p>IAs can be revised. A change of an IA should be considered if only minor
      changes (in the interface description or in an attached document, or in an involved party)
      need to be made. If the changes require major rework, different activities and deadlines,
      the current IA should be terminated and replaced by a new IA with new Resolution and 
      Validation Steps.</p>
    <p>Revisions and Requests for Status Changes (termination or towards resolution and closing of
      the IA) are handled as revisions of the original IA as it involves a mutual agreement
      between the involved parties and possibly some management action by the IFM. The specific
      chain of events can be traced through the various states of the specific IA.</p>
    <p>All actions on an IA are done through a purpose-specific workflow: Each workflow consists
      of tasks and status transitions. For any given task, either the IFM, the IFL or the IFP has
      the sole responsibility to perform necessary actions associated in that task and to initiate
      the next step.</p>
    <h3>IA Attributes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :code )%> together with the
      <%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :rev_no )%> defines a
      unique identifier for the IA. The format is: '<strong>IF&ndash;</strong>&lt;n&gt;<strong>&ndash;&lt;IA&gt;&ndash;</strong>&lt;m&gt;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&lt;IFL&gt;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&lt;IFP&gt;&nbsp;[&nbsp;<%= IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :revision_suffix, rev_no: '<r>' )%>&nbsp;]'
      where &lt;n&gt; is the related IF number, &lt;m&gt; the sequence number of the IA for this IF,
      and &lt;r&gt; the number of the revision. The suffix with the revision number is not shown if
      the revision number is zero). For example, the first IA for 'IF&ndash;009&ndash;COM&ndash;CIV' would be coded as
      'IF-009-IA-1-COM-CIV'. The second revision of this IA would be shown as 'IF&ndash;009&ndash;IA&ndash;1&ndash;COM&ndash;CIV&nbsp;<%= IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :revision_suffix, rev_no: '2' )%>'.<br/>
      The codes for the &lt;IFL&gt; and &lt;IFP&gt; refer to the groups of the IA-specific
      leading project group (the 'Interface Leader' or 
      <%= help_term IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :l_group_id)-%>), and
      and the IA-specific partner project group (the 'Interface Partner' or
      <%= help_term IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%>).</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :l_group_id )-%> is the group code
      of the <strong>IA-specific</strong> IFL. This group is responsible to lead the IA and to
      resolve the documented interface as per this agreement. This group can be the same as the
      IFL in the related IF but it can also be another group.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%> is the group code
      of the <strong>IA-specific</strong> IFP. This group is responsible to provide support 
      during the resolution of any issues related to the specified IF according to this IA. This group can be the same as the
      IFP in the related IF but it can also be another group.</li>
      <li>For each group, IFL and IFP, an owner and an optional deputy account shall be defined. Only
      the users with these accounts will have permission to perform the necessary tasks in this IA. These attributes are
      named: 
      <%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :l_owner_id )%>, 
      <%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )%>,
      <%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :l_deputy_id )%>, and
      <%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :p_deputy_id )%>.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :def_text )%> provides the detailed agreement
      information. 
      This text should detail specific deliveries and their delivery time frame - specific instruction
      and dates will be agreed within the Resolution and Validation Steps as action items. However, these
      details need to be sufficiently precise so each IA partner understands the scope of this 
      agreement.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :cfr_record_id )-%> allows the specification
      of a Central File Register (CFR) record linking to a single document or a set of documents 
      containing information on this IA. On input, you will need to enter the numerical
      <%= help_term t( 'isr_interfaces.form_if.cfr_record_id' )-%>. The button next to the input field
      labelled <%= help_term t( 'isr_interfaces.form_if.cfr_record_link' )-%> leads to the listing
      of all CFR records.<br/>
      When an IA is defined and frozen (when the IFL releases his definition), this CFR Record will
      be marked as 'frozen' such that no more changes to this CFR record can be made.<br/>
      It is the task of the Interface Manager to ensure that all related documents are correctly
      stored in the project's document management system.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :res_steps_id )%> links to the IA-specific
      Task/Issue/Action Item List which is to contain the action items leading to the resolution of this IA.
      When the respective checkbox field is marked, this list will be
      generated automatically with an IA-specific prefix
      '<strong>IF&ndash;</strong>&lt;n&gt;<strong>&ndash;IA&ndash;</strong>&lt;m&gt;<strong>&ndash;RS</strong>'
      corresponding to the inital part of the IA code.<br/>
      If - for any reason - this list becomes obsolete, it can be removed by unchecking the checkbox again.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :val_steps_id )%> links to the IA-specific
      Task/Issue/Action Item List which is to contain the action items leading to the validation of this IA.
      When the respective checkbox field is marked, this list will be
      generated automatically with an IA-specific prefix
      '<strong>IF&ndash;</strong>&lt;n&gt;<strong>&ndash;IA&ndash;</strong>&lt;m&gt;<strong>&ndash;VS</strong>'
      corresponding to the inital part of the IA code.<br/>
      If - for any reason - this list becomes obsolete, it can be removed by unchecking the checkbox again.</li>
      <li>IAs have a <%= IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :ia_status )%> field which shows the current status
      of this IA:<br/>
      <ul class="no-marker">
        <li>[0] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 0 ]%> for any IA after creation and before an agreement
        has been reached among the IA partners;</li>
        <li>[1] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 1 ]%> when both IA partners have agreed to this IA;</li>
        <li>[2] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 2 ]%> when both IA partners have confirmed that no further
        resolution activities are required, or all agreed resolution steps have been closed;</li>
        <li>[3] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 3 ]%> when both IA partners have confirmed that no further
        validation activities are required, or all agreed validation steps have been closed;</li>
        <li>[4] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 4 ]%> is used to mark IAs when a revision IA is currently
        in progress;</li>
        <li>[5] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 5 ]%> are those IAs which contain a request to change
        of the IA status but this request has not yet been confirmed by all parties;</li>
        <li>[6] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 6 ]%> is the status for those IAs which are succeeded by
        a revised version of this IA or a IA with a status change;</li>
        <li>[7] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 7 ]%> are those IAs which were terminated;</li>
        <li>[8] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 8 ]%> are those IAs which were withdrawn during creation;</li>
        <li>[9] <%= help_term IsrAgreement::ISR_IA_STATUS_LABELS[ 9 ]%> are those IAs originally containing a status
        change request which was eventually rejected by one IA partner.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>When the new or revised IA was released or the new status confirmed by the IFL, the attribute
      <%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :l_signature )%>
      contains the user information of the IFL who released the IA or who confirmed the new status.</li>
      <li>When the new or revised IA or the new status was confirmed by the IFP, the attribute
      <%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :p_signature )%>
      contains the user information of the IFP who made the confirmation.</li>
      <li>Correspondingly, <%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :sign_time )%> contains the date and time of
      the formal signing of the IA for each party individually.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :current_status_task )%> show the status and task of the IA
      within the current workflow. Detailed information on the workflow tasks and possible status transitions
      can be found <%= link_to 'here', isr_workflow_info_path %>.</li>
