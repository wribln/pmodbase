    <h3>Principles</h3>
    <p>Issue Logs, Action Items, To-Do and Task Lists are similar management 
      tools to drive the project: They collect various items for subsequent
      follow-up and final resolution.</p>
    <p>An <%= help_term 'Action Item (AI)' -%> is a documented task or event
      that needs to take place. They are discrete units that can be handled a
      single responsible person and a due date. Action Items are usually
      created during a discussion by a group of people who are meeting about
      one or more topics and during the discussion it is discovered that some
      kind of action is needed. The act required is then documented as an
      action item and usually assigned to someone, usually a member of the
      group. The person to whom the action is assigned is then obligated to
      perform the action and report back to the group on the results. Action
      Items are also the next steps people must take in order to resolve an 
      issue, mitigate a risk, or handle an unplanned activitiy.</p>
    <p>An <%= help_term 'Issue' -%> is defined as something in dispute or an 
      immediate problem requiring resolution. Issues are known problems that
      the team must overcome in order to achieve desired results.</p>
    <p>A <%= help_term 'Task' -%> in project management is an activity that
      needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time or by a
      deadline towards work-related goals.</p>
    <p>Issues, Tasks and Action Items are collected by work groups in lists
      as they are relevant to the groupâ€™s goals. Technically, there is no
      difference in the structure of those lists, but to underline the purpose
      of the list, I suggest to use different lists for Action Items, Issues,
      and tasks.</p>
    <h3>Access Structure</h3>
    <p><%= TiaList.model_name.human.pluralize -%> can be set up by any user of
      the system with the respective access level. This person would be the
      <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :owner ) -%>
      of this list. Another person could be defined as
      <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :deputy ) -%>
      who could act on behalf of the
      <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :owner ) -%>
      when he or she is not available, or has delegated the task of managing
      the lists.</p>
    <p>All items in each list are accessible by the
      <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :owner ) -%> or
      <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :deputy ) -%> via
      the link under the list's
      <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :label ) -%>. This link leads
      to a listing of all items in that specific list with the possibilities
      to add new items, update current items, or even to remove items (when
      permitted).</p>
    <p>For each list, a number of users need to be defined who can view their
      respective items. These users are administrable via the link from the
      <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :list_members ) -%>.</p>
    <h3>Attributes of Lists</h3>
    <p>The following attributes are managed here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param TiaList.human_attribute_name( :id ) -%> is the system-wide
        identifier of this list. This is generated by the system and cannot be set or 
        changed.</li>
      <li><%= help_param TiaList.human_attribute_name( :code ) -%> is a short code
        to be used for this list, specifically as prefix for all items in this list.
        You should choose a unique code so you can distinguish items by the item code
        which is created by this code followed by a sequence number. For example,
        the list code 'ABC' would prefix all items 'ABC-1', 'ABC-2', and so on.<br/>
        If no <%= help_param TiaList.human_attribute_name( :code  ) -%> is specified,
        the resulting item ids would be noted as '-1-', '-2-', etc.</li>
      <li><%= help_param TiaList.human_attribute_name( :label ) -%> provides a
        long heading of the list which is used as descriptive title for any collection
        of items in this list.</li>
      <li><%= help_param TiaList.human_attribute_name( :owner_account_id  ) -%> is
        the account of the user who created this list. On the index page, this
        information is translated and shown as the user's names in the column
        <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :owner ) -%>. The link under
        this information leads to contact details of that person.</li>
      <li><%= help_param TiaList.human_attribute_name( :deputy_account_id ) -%> is
        the account of the user who can manage this list as deputy of the owner.
        On the index page, this information is translated and shown as the user's 
        names in the column
        <%= help_term TiaList.human_attribute_name( :deputy ) -%>.  The link under
        this information leads to contact details of that person.<br/>
        One of the above must correspond to the current user's account id, i.e. the
        user creating or modifying these attributes of a list must either be the
        owner or the deputy.</li>
      <li><%= help_param TiaList.human_attribute_name( :list_members ) -%> allows
        you to specify a text which should describe those project members which should
        have access to the action items in the list. On the index page, this text
        provides the link to an index page of all members of this list where you
        can add, modify, or remove members. For example, if the action item list
        is for the department Jour Fixe meetings, you could name the group 
        'Department'.</li>
