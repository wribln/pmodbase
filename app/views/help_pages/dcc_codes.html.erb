    <p class="lead">Document Classification Codes categorize documents according to the type
      of content.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of the DCC is to define certain standard codes such that all
      documents with the same kind of content will use the same code: Hence, it is not
      important to choose a 'correct' (according to the standard) code but a single
      code for a specific type of document.</p>
    <p>For this reason, most sample document types are marked as not active. When a DCC
      is used for the first time, the respective record should be activated and the 
      label should be updated if necessary. Alternatively, a new record with the same
      DCC and a new label could be created to indicate which type of document uses the
      same code.</p> 
    <p>DCCs are managed using the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <%= help_param DccCode.human_attribute_name( :code ) -%> must be a short
        alphanumeric code with the prefix '&amp;A'. This code may also contain
        periods and dashes.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param DccCode.human_attribute_name( :label ) -%>
        describes the service represented by the 
        <%= help_term DccCode.human_attribute_name( :code ) -%>.</li>
      <li>The flag <%= help_param DccCode.human_attribute_name( :active ) -%>
        marks a code as being currently usable in the system (true = active) or not
        (false = inactive). Inactive codes must not be used.</li>
      <li>The flag <%= help_param DccCode.human_attribute_name( :heading ) -%>
        specifies that this code should not be used as code per se but serves as an
        explanatory heading within the coding structure. Setting this flags requires
        the that the <%= help_term DccCode.human_attribute_name( :active ) -%>
        and <%= help_term DccCode.human_attribute_name( :master ) -%>
        flags are both clear (false).</li>
      <li>The flag <%= help_param DccCode.human_attribute_name( :master ) -%>
        indicates that this entry is used as main entry for the associated code, i.e.
        when listing the code structure and a single entry per code is required, then
        the code marked with 
        <%= help_term DccCode.human_attribute_name( :master ) -%> should be listed.</li>
      <li>Codes having the <%= help_param DccCode.human_attribute_name( :standard ) -%> 
        flag set, are taken from an (internal) standard. Such codes must not be removed, they
        should only be set to 'inactive'.
      <li>The <%= help_param DccCode.human_attribute_name( :note ) -%> field can be
        used by the administrator to make any explanatory or organisational remarks
        on this code.</li>
