    <p class="lead">Manage each and every file and their relations within the Central File Registry (CFR)</p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The CFR - Central File Registry - is the collection of information on documents and files. Its
      purpose is to provide documentation on each and every file used in the project's life. This
      is actually a task which should be covered by the project's document management system (DMS).
      However, it appears in reality that many files are created outside of the project's DMS and
      there is no way to keep track when, where and which file was used for which purpose.</p>
    <p>The CFR provides means to keep track of individual files, their attributes, their location in
      a DMS, on a server or elsewhere - even in a paper storage facility. The CFR will not store
      any files itself but you can use it to keep track where the file is located, what relation it 
      has to other files, and more.</p>
    <p>Another purpose of the CFR is to minimize the input of redundant information on documents and
      files: If a file is referred to in one pmodbase feature, the information in the CFR can be
      used to provide that information.</p>
    <p>Since it is possible to store the path of the file in the CFR, a hyperlink to that file can be
      provided which will lead you directly to the file in that storage system - provided you have
      sufficient access permissions.</p>
    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
    <p>Since the terms 'document' and 'file' are often used interchangeably, the following 
      definitions are important to understand:
      <ul>
        <li>A <%= help_term 'Document' -%> is a written, drawn, presented or recorded representation
          of thoughts (according to Wikipedia). Files on a computer could thus be considered as
          electronic Documents. However, when a document is published, it may be created from a set
          of files which in their entirety would be presented as a single document.</li>
        <li>Hence, a <%= help_term 'File' -%> can be a complete document (for example, a drawing or
        a letter), but a Document may technically consist of various files (header page, text, one
        or more appendices, pictures, drawings, etc.).</li>
        <li>Finally, the same Document may be represented by a source file (for example, a text
        document created by a wordprocessor software) and by a printer-ready formatted file - often
        a PDF-file. This would be the situation where a Document exists in more than format.</li>
        <li>Even more complex is the situation where a Document consists in several versions (or
        revisions): Each version is a Document itself but all versions relate to the same Document.</li>
      </ul>
      The CFR manages information/attributes of Files as the smallest unit of information. But the CFR allows you to keep track of the relationship between files such that you can easily traces which
      files belong to a Document, or which files represent different versions of a document. You can
      even use the CFR to group files (just like folders on a computer): Just create a CFR entry
      (called <%= help_term 'CFR Record'-%>) with no actual file associated to it;
      then create a relation from all files in this 'folder' to this CFR Record.</p>
    <p>Although many attributes of a File can be collected in the CFR, there is are no required
      attributes - not even a filename: Only a unique identifier (ID) will be created for you for 
      each and every File in the CFR.</p>
    <p>This allows you to add as little or as much information as you like about your file. The
      catch is: The more you tell the CFR about your file, the easier it will be to find it again
      among all the files in the CFR.</p>
    <h3>CFR Record Attributes</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, a CFR entry is called <%= help_term 'CFR Record'-%>. A CFR Record
      can be used to describe a file, a folder, a document (consisting of several files, or 
      several versions of the document), an email message, etc. All attributes are optional, 
      some attributes will be set automatically if possible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :title ) -%> should describe the
      File, folder or document. It would be a good choice to use the actual title of the
      document for this attribute. In case of emails, you could use the subject of the email here.
      If no title is given but the electronic file's path, the tool can try to extra the name of
      the file from the path and used this as 
      <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :title ) -%>.</li>
      <li>Use the <%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :note )-%> field for any 
      additional information about the file or the document. For emails, you could indicate the
      sender and receivers. You could also define hashtags to mark specific topics. Please note,
      that the maximum number of characters is limited here (currently:
      <%= MAX_LENGTH_OF_DESCRIPTION -%>) for performance reasons.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :conf_level )-%> should be used to
      note any restriction on the visibility of the file: Depending on the access level of the
      user, information on files with a higher restriction might be blocked from being viewed. For
      more information on the access to the information in the CFR, see <a href="#access">below</a>.</li>
      <li>If the attribute <%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :group_id )-%> is given,
      access to records will be restricted to users with specific access rights for this group.</li>
      <li>The attribute <%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :doc_version )-%> can be used
      to show the version or release string as shown on the cover of the document.</li>
      <li>Likewise, the attribute <%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :doc_date )-%> should
      be used to show the (release) date of the document as shown on the cover sheet.</li>
      <li><%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :doc_owner )-%> will be set to the user who
      created the CFR Record unless another string is specified. This attribute should enable the
      reader to refer to the person responsible for that file or document which could be the 
      original author (as shown on the cover sheet), the owner, or any other person which can be
      contacted about this file or document.</li>
      <li><%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :cfr_location_id )-%> determines the default
      storage location of the document (if more than one is given): The link to this storage location
      will be used as hyperlink for the file.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :extension )-%> helps to identify
      the type of the file: By default, this information is part of the file name and will be derived
      from there. If this is not possible, you can manually set this information using the
      attribute <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :cfr_file_type_id )-%>.</li>
      <li>The attribute <%= help_param CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :cfr_file_type_id )-%>
      shows what type of file this is. This information is normally automatically retrieved from the
      attribute <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :extension )-%>. Both
      attributes should match or correspond but for searching/filterning only the attribute
      <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :cfr_file_type_id )-%> is used.</li>
      <li>The attribute <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :hash_value )-%> can be used
      to store the result of a <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :hash_function )-%> for
      the given file: This enables you to verify that the file contents has not changed, or if two
      files are identical - even if they have a different name.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The next set up attributes can be set for each storage location where this file is located, i.e.
      you specify here where you keep a copy of this file. If you only have a single copy, enter the
      attributes once for location of the file. If the file is kept in two locations, for example, in
      the project's DMS and on a server, you can add both locations here for the file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select a <%= help_param CfrLocation.human_attribute_name( :cfr_location_type_id )-%> from
      the set of <%= help_term CfrLocationType.model_name.human -%> where the given file is located.</li>
      <li>If the location refers to a file servers or a drive on your computer, select a file from
      via <%= help_param CfrLocation.human_attribute_name( :file_name )-%>. The other attribute
      <%= help_term CfrLocation.human_attribute_name( :uri )-%> will be derived from this 
      information and the file name (including the extension) will be saved in this field.</li>
      <li>If the location refers to a document management system, use the attribute
      <%= help_param CfrLocation.human_attribute_name( :doc_code )-%> to document the file's
      location but omit the version suffix as this needs to be treated separately:</li>
      <li>The attribute <%= help_param CfrLocation.human_attribute_name( :doc_version )-%> shall
      hold the version suffix of the document code: Thus, document code and version suffix can be
      accessed separately from other features.</li>
      <li><%= help_param CfrLocation.human_attribute_name( :uri )-%> shall hold the complete
      network URI to the given file or document, such that a hyperlink to that document can be
      created for the browser. For files on a file system, a complete path is needed here: 
      The tool will automatically fix the path so it becomes a well-formatted network URI.<br/>
      Network URIs must start with 'http://', 'https://', ftp://' or 'file://'. A local path on
      a Windows system must start with a drive character 'A'..'Z' followed by a colon. A local
      path on a Unix system must start with a single '/'.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>When searching through the CFR, a search for a string in the 
      <%= help_term I18n.t('cfr_records.index.title_filename')%> filter field will also search through: 
      <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :title )-%>,
      <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :note )-%>, 
      <%= help_term CfrLocation.human_attribute_name( :file_name )-%>, and the
      <%= help_term CfrLocation.human_attribute_name( :doc_code )-%>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="access">Access</h3>
    <p>All users (with an account) will have access to the index view of the CFR and to all
    Records with unrestricted access 
    (<%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :conf_level )-%>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) and no
    project group assignment.</p>
    <p>CFR Records with an assigned <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :group_id )-%>
    are restricted to users with permission to access records for this group. These users will
    see all CFR Records in the index (regardsless of the 
    <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :conf_level )-%>.</p>
    <p>The access level per user and action will determine which  
    <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :conf_level )-%> this user can access: A user
    with update access level 3 may modify CFR Records with
    <%= help_term CfrRecord.human_attribute_name( :conf_level )-%>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 and lower
    for the given project group.</p>
    <h3>Order</h3>
    <p>When listing CFR Records in the index view, the records are shown in reverse order of the
    ID, i.e. most recently created records are shown first.</p>
