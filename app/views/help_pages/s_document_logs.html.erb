    <p class="lead">The Siemens Document Log records and maintains meta-data on documents.</p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>For certain, confidential files, storage and management in a project-public system is
      not advisable. The Siemens Document Log (SDL) provide means to create and maintain the
      meta-data whereas the files themself are stored in a separate location, most likely an
      access-controlled server.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The automatically generated <%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :id ) -%>
        is used as unambiguous document number. The database management system maintains this
        number and ensures that no number is used twice.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :group_id )%> determines the 
        project group responsible for the creation of the document. Only active groups for
        which the user has permissions are shown here and can be selected.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :receiver_group )%> is the
        party for which this document was prepared. This parameter is used only for 
        correspondence documents such as letters addressed to a specific party. For technical
        documents, this parameter can be left blank. The list of possible codes is restricted
        to those which have the <%= help_term Group.human_attribute_name( :s_code_receiver )%> and
        <%= help_term Group.human_attribute_name( :active )%> flags set.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At least one of the following attributes must be given:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :function_code )%> can be selected
        from the list of codes having the <%= help_term FunctionCode.human_attribute_name( :active )-%>
        flag set. When this value is displayed, the label for the code having the 
        <%= help_term FunctionCode.human_attribute_name( :master )-%> is shown.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :service_code )%> can be selected
        from the list of codes having the <%= help_term ServiceCode.human_attribute_name( :active )-%>
        flag set. When this value is displayed, the label for the code having the 
        <%= help_term ServiceCode.human_attribute_name( :master )-%> is shown.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :product_code )%> can be selected
        from the list of codes having the <%= help_term ProductCode.human_attribute_name( :active )-%>
        flag set. When this value is displayed, the label for the code having the 
        <%= help_term ProductCode.human_attribute_name( :master )-%> is shown.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :location_code )%> can be selected
        from the list of available codes. As there are no duplicate codes allowed, the label
        for the selected code will always be the same.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :phase_code )-%> can be selected
        from the list of available codes. As there are no duplicate codes allowed, the label
        for the selected code will always be the same.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :dcc_code )%> can be selected
        from the list of codes having the <%= help_term DccCode.human_attribute_name( :active )-%>
        flag set. When this value is displayed, the label for the code having the 
        <%= help_term DccCode.human_attribute_name( :master )-%> is shown. This is a
        required attribute and must always be set.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :revision_code )-%> provides a
        field to enter the applicable revision number or code. There will be no further tests on this
        code.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :author_date )-%> should be used to
        enter the date when the document was officially released (as it appears on the cover
        page). If no date is input, the current date will be used as default.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :title )-%> provides a field for the
        title of the document. Although this is not used as part of the code, it can be used to
        search for a specific document with this title or parts of it.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :siemens_doc_id )-%> shows the generated
        document code, or - when modifying a record - the previously generated code.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SDocumentLog.human_attribute_name( :user )-%> is for information only
        and shows the name of the user who created this entry.</li>
    </ul>
