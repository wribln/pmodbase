    <p class="lead">You have a document ready for review, what do you need to do in order to
    release this document for an Initial Review within the Present-Comment Process (PCP)?</p>
    <p>It must be noted here that a formal release between project parties is considered 
      to be the responsibility of the project's document management group: They need to prepare
      certain release papers, get them signed by the respective managers, add all this
      information into the project's document management system (DMS) and forward the paperwork to
      the commenting party.</p>
    <p>The release of PCP Subjects here is somewhat similar in nature but is a rather
      technical activity: The release of a PCP Subject (for example a document or drawing)
      supports the above formal release process as we will see later. But the important
      difference is that such a technical release of a PCP Subject transfers the access and
      responsibility for a PCP Subject from one project party to another. This means in
      fact that the releasing party cannot any longer make changes to the observations,
      issues, comments, or responses: It is now the turn of the other party to make comments.</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>I assume for the following that you are the owner or the author of that document (or
        drawing) - called PCP Subject from now on. Furthermore, you have already added your document
        as PCP Subject into the pmodbase database. This help text now explains in detail which steps you need to take in order to present your document to the commenting party, i.e. how you perform the
        initial technical release of your PCP Subject.</li>
      <li>You need to have the following information ready:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>The version or revision code or number of your document or drawing.</li>
          <li>The initial version or revision code to be used for the release document
            (which will be created automatically by the pmodbase application): This is
            often 'A', '0', or '1' - depending on your project's DMS.</li>
          <li>Any additional information to be included in the release document, e.g.
            release notes, due date for the return of comments.</li>
          </ul></li>
      <li>After you haved signed on to the pmodbase application, you should find a button labelled
      <%= link_to Feature.find( FEATURE_ID_MY_PCP_SUBJECTS ).label, pcp_subjects_path,
        target: '_blank' -%> (or use the previous link).</li>
      <li>Clicking on this button will lead you to all PCP Subjects to which you have access to,
        for example:<br/>
      <%= image_tag 'pcp_how_to_13a.png', alt: 'List of My PCP Subjects', class: 'img-responsive' -%></li>
      <li>Select the PCP Subject you want to release and click on the [Q] button on the right column
        of that row. This will open up a form with all information about the current status of your
        PCP Subject:</li>
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p><br/>On the top of this form, you find the attributes of the PCP Subject: Title,
        Document Codes, Owner and Deputy Groups and Accounts, and the current Status.</p>
        <p>Below that, you see the information about the current step, i.e. the Initial Release. These
        fields are currently empty and you need to provide the necessary information before the PCP
        subject can be formally released for the next step in the process.</p>
        <p>Click the <%= help_term t( 'button_label.edit' )-%> button to open the form for editing.</p>
        <p>Some fields in the upper part of the form can be modified at this time others cannot be
        changed here: For example, the commenting party, owner and deputy of this process there
        can only be changed by someone in that party.</p>
        <p>The first field in the lower part of this form,
        <%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_date )-%>, is not
        required for the review of documents although you can enter the document's creation date
        here for information (if given, it should correspond to the date on the document itself.</p>
        <p><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_version )-%> is a required field for
        this step: Enter here the version or release code / number for the document being released. 
        This is most likely the initial code 'A' or '0' depending on the DMS you are using in your
        project. This code must correspond to the (normally) last part of your document's code.</p>
        <p><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :report_version )-%> is also a required
        field: Enter here the initial version or release code for the release document to be
        created for this release. Again, this is often 'A' or '0' depending on the document
        management system you are using.</p>
        <p><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :note )-%> is a field for information
        which will only be shown to the releasing (the presenting) group. For the initial release,
        you probably do not need to add anything there.</p>
        <p><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :release_note )-%> can be used to add
        information for the release document being created.</p>
        <p><%= help_param t( 'pcp_subjects.form.next_due_date', step: PcpStep.step_state_label( 1 ))-%>
        can be used to set a date when the review comments are expected to be returned.</p>  
        <p>Once you have completed the form, click <%= help_term t( 'helpers.submit.update')-%>:
        This will again show you the details of your PCP Subject and the current step data.</p>
        <p>In order to perform the technical release, click the
        <%= help_term t( 'button_label.release' )-%> button now. This will open a new window
        with the release document and an extra message telling you that the PCP Subject is
        now released and that you should print the following screen.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <%= image_tag 'pcp_how_to_13b.png', alt: 'Details on PCP Subject', class: 'img-responsive' -%>
      </div>
      </div>
      <%= image_tag 'pcp_how_to_13d.png', alt: 'Release PCP Subject', class: 'img-responsive' -%>
      <li>Click on the <%= help_term t( 'button_label.print' )%> link on top of the page and
      use you browser's print feature to create a printed (or PDF) version of this page. Save this
      release document and ensure that it is added to your DMS (either by
      yourself or by your document management group).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This completes the release of this PCP Subject. Now it is the commenting group's turn to
    add comments, observations, issues and make an assessment of the document.</p>
