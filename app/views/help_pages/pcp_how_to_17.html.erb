    <p class="lead">If you do not or cannot use your project's main document management 
    system to store all documents related to a Present-Comment Process (PCP), this text
    shows you how to setup a CFR (Central File Register) structure to hold all PCP-related
    documents.</p>
    <p>In a simple PCP, you are dealing with a single <strong>PCP Document Version&nbsp;0</strong>
    which will be released for review. The initial release report would be the 
    <strong>Release Report Version&nbsp;0</strong>. When all comments are collected, these comments
    would be returned in the <strong>Response Report Version&nbsp;1</strong>. After modifications
    of the <strong>PCP Document</strong>, a new version&nbsp;1 is released with the
    <strong>Release Report Version&nbsp;2</strong>. Hopefully, all questions could be answered and 
    the final <strong>Response Report Version&nbsp;3</strong> would contain the approval of the
    document.</p>

    <p>Each document (PCP Document, Release Report, Response Report) is added to the CFR as
    individual record. The respective relations can be set accordingly:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Release Reports</strong> have a <em>is release document for</em> relationship
    to the submitted <strong>PCP Document</strong> (the reverse relationship is: 
    <em>is released by</em>).</li>
    <li>The corresponding <strong>Response Report</strong> <em>contains remarks on</em> the
    previously submitted <strong>PCP Document</strong>.</li>
    <li>The modified version of the <strong>PCP Document</strong> <em>is successor of</em>
    the original version (the reverse relationship is: <em>is predecessor of</em>)</li>.
    </ul>
    <p>In a more complex situation, you might be involved in a PCP where the PCP subject 
    is not a single document but a set of two (or more) files. Both files are to be reviewed
    and the review results include comments on both files.</p>
    <p>In this case, you should define a CFR record <strong>PCP Document Set Version&nbsp;0</strong>
    as container for the two files <strong>File&nbsp;1</strong> and <strong>File&nbsp;2</strong>,
    both as <strong>Version&nbsp;0</strong>. Link both files with a <em>belongs to</em> relationship
    to this <strong>PCP Document Set Version&nbsp;0</strong>.</p>
    <%= image_tag 'pcp_cfr_structure_02.png', alt: 'Schematic CFR Structure for a PCP', class: 'img-responsive' -%>
    <p>The PCP would then consider this set of files as PCP Document.</p>
    <p>For the second round of the PCP, I assume that only a modification of the second file
    is required before the package can be approved. This would then lead to a new CFR
    record for the <strong>PCP Document Set</strong> but this time it would be
    <strong>Version&nbsp;1</strong> as it contains the <strong>File&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;0</strong>
    and <strong>File&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1</strong> to be reviewed in the PCP.</p>
