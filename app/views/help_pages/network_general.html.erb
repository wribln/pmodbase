    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In order to use the information about the Network features efficiently,
      it is important to understand the relationship between <em>Lines</em>, <em>Stations</em>,
      and <em>Stops</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <u>Station</u> is defined here as the building (or structure) used as a <em>Stop</em>
        on one or more <em>Lines</em>.</li>
      <li>A <u>Stop</u> is a <em>Station</em> along a specific <em>Line</em>.</li>
      <li>A <u>Line</u> is a section of the network with a distinct chainage (i.e. with a starting
      point coordiate (in m or km) and an ending point coordinate where the total length of the
      line is the difference between the start and end point).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following examples will clarify this concept:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A single tram line starting at km 0+000 and ending at km 10+000 with 15 Tram stops would consist of
      <ul>
         <li>1 <em>Line</em> (10 km long, from km 0+000 to km 10+000)</li>
         <li>15 named <em>Stations</em></li>
         <li>15 <em>Stops</em></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In a more complex case, where north-bound trains have 1 differently named stop than
        south-bound trains, you could consider:
      <ul>
        <li>2 <em>Lines</em> - one north-bound, one south-bound - with identical chainage</li>
        <li>16 named <em>Stations</em>, 14 named identical, 1 specific to the north-bound line, 1 specific to the south-bound line</li>
        <li>30 <em>Stops</em> (14 * 2 + 1 + 1)</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Two metro lines, Line A with 11 stops, and Line B with 7 stops, and one transfer station would be configured as:
      <ul>
        <li>2 <em>Lines</em></li>
        <li>17 <em>Stations</em> - 10 on Line A, 6 on Line B, one transfer used by both lines</li>
        <li>18 <em>Stops</em> - 11 on Line A, 7 on Line B</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In more complex networks, a transfer station could serve three or more lines. 
    When planning networks, there could well be transfer stations which serve only a single line at that planning stage.</p>
    <p>Hence, a <em>Stop</em> is always associated with a single line; a <em>Station</em> may be used as stop by one or more
    lines</p>
    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p>When assigning attributes for network locations, it is important to consider this difference:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Station</em> attributes should be those related to the structure of the station, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>no of levels in a metro stations</li>
      <li>no of offices in the station building</li>
      <li>type of station (elevated, at grade, underground)</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Other attributes are specific to the line <em>Stop</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>platform type (island/center, or sides)</li>
      <li>no of platform sides (to be considered for platform screen door installations)</li>
      <li>platform level (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
