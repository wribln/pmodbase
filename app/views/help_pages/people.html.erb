    <p class="lead">Information managed on each person involved in the project.</p>
    <p>An individual person is the key entity in a project. Each person 
      belongs to - normally only one - <%= link_to_help( :group, 'Project Group' )%>.
      Within that project group, a person has certain responsibilities or 
      functions. These are described in the <%= link_to_help( 'Responsibility' )%>
      record.</p>
    <p>Each person maintains her or his
      <%= link_to_help( :contact_info, 'Contact Information' )%> in separate
      records. These are accessible via the link under the user name on the
      <%= link_to_help( :base, "Base page" )%>.</p>
    <p>In total, the following information about each person involved in
      the project is collected:</p>
    <ul>
  	  <li><%= help_param Person.human_attribute_name( :formal_name )%> is
        the name of the respective person as it would be used for any formal
        salutation. This is normally the full name of the person, optionally
        prefixed with the title, for example: <em>Christian Q. Sample</em>,
        or <em>Dr. Jos&eacute; Eduardo Santos Tavares Melo Silva</em>, or
        <em>Yao Ming</em>. This name should enable all others to correctly
  	    address this person in any official communication matters.</li>
  	  <li><%= help_param Person.human_attribute_name( :informal_name )%>
        could be the first name, or a nickname or moniker - the name, people
        would use in the project to address the person on informal occasions.
        The <%= Person.human_attribute_name( :informal_name )%> is also used
        as salutation on this site, or in e-mails to you generated by this
        site. The examples above could have the following informal names:
        <em>Chris</em>, <em>Joe</em>, <em>Fred</em>.</li>
  	  <li><%= help_param Person.human_attribute_name( :email )%> is the
        official e-mail address to be used for communication on project
        matters. This would normally be the company e-mail address, and not
        the private e-mail address of the person. The e-mail address must be
        unique within the pmodbase application as this e-mail address is used to
        ensure that each person is entered only once into the system.</li>
  	  <li><%= help_param Person.human_attribute_name( :involved )%> is
        simply a flag which indicates whether the person is currently still
        active in the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further contact information, such as phone numbers, department code,
      address information, etc. is collected in separate records. Each person
      with an account has access to his own data and the related contact information
      and is thus able to keep them up-to-date.</p>
    <p>A Personal Data record is normally not removed from the pmodbase
      database, it can only be set to "not involved".</p>
    <p>Only registered persons can have an account in the pmodbase application.</p>
    <p>Group managers have the permission to add new persons to the pmodbase
      application: If a new responsibility is defined for a new person, that
      person will be added to the pmodbase application at that time. If the same
      person has several responsibilities within the project, only one record
      with personal data is used but several responsibility records - one for
      each topic - will be created. Also, if a person works for, or is member
      of, more than one project group, the various responsibility records
      shall refer to the same personal data record.</p>
