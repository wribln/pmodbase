    <%= link_to_help :sir_logs_general, 'here' %>.</p>
    <h3>SIR Log Attributes</h3>
    <p>The following attributes are managed on the SIR Log level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param SirLog.human_attribute_name( :id )%> is the internal number of this SIR Log.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SirLog.human_attribute_name( :label )%> is the title or the topic of the SIR Log.
      This parameter is required as it will be used a link text on related pages.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SirLog.human_attribute_name( :code )%> is a short combination of characters which
      will be used as prefix to the SIR Log Item numbers. If - for example - this code is 'SL', the first SIR Log Item
      in this list would be identified by 'SL-1', the second 'SL-2', and so on. This parameter is
      required.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SirLog.human_attribute_name( :owner_account_id )%> is the account of the owner of
      this SIR Log: This user will be able to create SIR Log Items for this SIR Log and is permitted to maintain
      the group of users who will be allowed to access the SIR Log Items in this SIR Log (see below for details).</li>
      <li><%= help_param SirLog.human_attribute_name( :deputy_account_id )%> is the account of the deputy
      user. This user - when specified - will have the same rights on the SIR Log Items</li>
      <li><%= help_param SirLog.human_attribute_name( :archived )%> is a flag which controls
      whether this list is shown in the index view of all SIR Logs: set this flag when this SIR Log is
      not actively maintained anymore.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Members</h3>
    <p>The SIR Log administration includes the adminstration of other users and their access permissions
    for the given SIR Log and its Items. Only users explicitly listed as Members of this SIR Log may view - and
    possibly edit - any SIR Log Entries. The following attributes are managed per member:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param SirMember.human_attribute_name( :account_id ) -%> needs to be
        the account number of the project member to be added to the list of members for this SIR Log.
        You can find this information under the link
        <%= help_param I18n.t( 'base.menu.my_data' )-%> for your own account, or on 
        the list of project member accounts accessible on the link
        <%= help_term t( 'general.accounts_link' )%> next to this field above.
        When viewing details of the members, the link next to the
        <%= help_term SirMember.human_attribute_name( :account_id ) -%> 
        leads to the contact information of the account's owner.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SirMember.human_attribute_name( :to_access ) -%> is a flag which - when set - 
        permits this project member to view SIR Log Items and related SIR Log Entries.</li>
      <li><%= help_param SirMember.human_attribute_name( :to_update ) -%> permits - when set - the
        project member to comment on a SIR Log Item in the SIR Log. However,
        this flag is ignored when this person is not permitted to access this item (refer to 
        <%= help_term SirMember.human_attribute_name( :to_access ) -%>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Index</h3>
    <p>All SIR Logs in the pmodbase application are listed in the order they were created. The link under the 
    <%= help_term SirLog.human_attribute_name( :label )%> leads to the index page of the SIR Log Items belonging
    to this SIR Log.</p>
    <p>The group listed in the column <%= help_term t( 'sir_items.index.resp_group_curr' )%> is the group which
    is currently responsible for the next SIR Log Entry. Initially - when no entry exists yet - this is identical
    to the <%= help_term t( 'sir_items.index.resp_group_item' )%>.</p>
    <h3>Access Permissions</h3>
    <p>Owner and Deputy of the SIR Log need access permissions for the feature
    <%= help_term Feature.find_by_id( FEATURE_ID_SIR_LOGS ).label_with_id-%> in order to manage
    attributes of the SIR Log and its participants.</p>
    <p>Only the Owner and the Deputy may view details of a SIR Log - all others may only view the list
    of SIR Logs: As the details only contain the list of participants and not more information, this
    should be sufficient.</p>
    <p>Participants need read permission to access the SIR Log Items in a SIR Log (feature
    <%= help_term Feature.find_by_id( FEATURE_ID_SIR_ITEMS ).label_with_id-%>). They also
    need read -&nbsp;and possibly edit&nbsp;- permissions to the feature 
    <%= help_term Feature.find_by_id( FEATURE_ID_SIR_ENTRIES ).label_with_id-%> in order
    to access and update SIR Log Entries for the SIR Log Items in this SIR Log.</p>
    <p>The access is restricted to the groups for which the project member has access permissions.</p>
