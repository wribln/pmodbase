    <h3>Attributes of PCP Subjects</h3>
    <p>Each PCP Subject belongs to a specific PCP Category. Overall statistics
      on the status of all subjects will be collected per PCP Category.</p>
    <p>PCP Subjects represent the status of typical review/comment processes:
      An PCP Subject is often a document to be reviewed by another party. Any
      review comments are returned to the originating party: Problems are 
      resolved by updating the original document or by clarifying responses to
      the initial comments. The updated document is re-submitted and the process
      is repeated until the document has reached an 'approved' status.</p>
    <p>The status of each process step (submission - review - response - re-review -...)
      is collected in the current PCP Step section of the PCP Subject.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :id ) -%> is the unique
        identifier of the PCP Subject.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :pcp_category ) -%> is
        the PCP Category to which this PCP Subject belongs to. The initial assignment
        to specific project groups (originating/responding and reviewing/observing group)
        is taken from the PCP Category setting when a new PCP Subject is created.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :desc )-%> is a description
        of the subject under review, for documents, this should be the document's title.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :note )-%> provides a field
        for remarks and tags on the subjects. Tags can be used to categorize statistics on
        the PCP Subjects within a specific PCP Category.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :project_doc_id )-%> should
        be used to enter the complete document EDMS code for the document under review - 
        without the version code: This will be entered further below in the PCP Step
        section.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_deputy_id )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_group_id )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_owner_id )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_deputy_id )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :archived )-%> is a flag which 
        can be used to 'hide' closed PCP Subjects: This flag becomes visible for
        modification when an PCP Subject has a 'closed' status. If this flag is set,
        this PCP Subject will not be listed anymore here. However, it will still be 
        used for any statistics on the PCP Subjects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Attributes on the Current PCP Step</h3>
    <p>These attributes can only be set by the party currently in charge of the
      process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_date )-%> is the date
        on which the PCP Subject has reached the current status: For documents, this
        could be the release date as shown on the document's meta data. For site
        visits, this would be the date of the site visit. The originating/responding party can
        set this attribute, the reviewing/observing party can only view this attribute.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_version )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :note )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :due_date )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :assessment )-%>...</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_status )-%> is automatically
        set to <%= help_term PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_states )[ 0 ]-%> when a new subject is created; after the
        first round - when the initial observations are released to the originating party -
        the status changes to <%= help_term PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_states )[ 1 ]-%>; finally, the status is
        set to <%= help_term PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_states )[ 2 ]-%> when any of the terminal assessment states
        have been reached.</li>
