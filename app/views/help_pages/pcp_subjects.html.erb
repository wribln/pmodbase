    <h3>Attributes of PCP Subjects</h3>
    <p>Each PCP Subject belongs to a specific PCP Category. Overall statistics
      on the status of all subjects will be collected per PCP Category.</p>
    <p>PCP Subjects represent the status of typical present and comment processes:
      An PCP Subject is often a document to be reviewed by another project group.
      Any review comments are returned to the originating/presenting project group.
      Issues are resolved by providing an updated version of the original document
      or by clarifying responses to the initial comments. The updated document is
      re-submitted and the process is repeated until the document has reached an
      'approved' status and the PCP Subject reaches a 'closed' state.</p>
    <p>The status of each process step (submission - review - response - re-review -...)
      is collected in the current <a href='#pcp_step'>PCP Step
        section</a> of the PCP Subject.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :id ) -%> is the unique
        identifier of the PCP Subject.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :pcp_category_id ) -%> shows
        which category this PCP Subject belongs to. The initial assignment
        to specific project groups (originating/responding and reviewing/commenting group)
        is taken from the PCP Category setting when a new PCP Subject is created.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :title )-%> is a description
        of the subject under review; for documents, this should be the document's title;
        others could be the event (a site visit) where observations were made which 
        require a resolution.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :note )-%> provides a field
        for remarks and tags on the specific PCP Subject. Tags can be used to categorize
        statistics on the PCP Subjects within a specific PCP Category.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :project_doc_id )-%> should
        be used to enter the complete document EDMS code for the document under review - 
        without the version code: This will be entered further below in the <a href='#pcp_step'>PCP Step
        section</a>.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%> is the 
        project group presenting the PCP Subject for review and comment. For documents
        and drawings, this would be the project group which prepared the document or
        drawing.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )-%> is the
        principal owner of this PCP Subject when the 
        <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%> is responsible
        for the PCP Subject. Both, the 
        <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )-%> and the
        <%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_deputy_id )-%>, are
        authorized to release a PCP Subject to the next process step.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_group_id )-%> is the
        project group invited to review and comment on the presented PCP Subject.
        For documents and drawings, this would be the project group reviewing and
        preparing comments on the submitted document or drawing.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_owner_id )-%> is the 
        principal owner of the PCP Subject when the
        <%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_group_id )-%> is responsible
        for the PCP Subject. Both, the  
        <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_owner_id )-%> and the
        <%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_deputy_id )-%>, are
        authorized to release a PCP Subject to the next process step.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :archived )-%> is a flag which 
        can be used to 'hide' closed PCP Subjects: This flag becomes visible for
        modification when an PCP Subject has a 'closed' status. If this flag is set,
        this PCP Subject will not be listed anymore here. However, it will still be 
        used for any statistics on the PCP Subjects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id='pcp_step'>Attributes on the Current PCP Step</h3>
    <p>These attributes can only be set by the project group currently in charge of the
      process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_date )-%> is the date
        on which the PCP Subject has reached the current status: For documents, this
        could be the release date as shown on the document's meta data. For site
        visits, this would be the date of the site visit. The 
        <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%> can
        set this attribute, the 
        <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :c_group_id )-%>
        can only view this attribute.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_version )-%> should be
        the version identifier of a document or drawing submitted for review. This is
        normally a suffix to the 
        <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :project_doc_id )-%>. This
        attribute can only be set by the 
        <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%>.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :note )-%> is a field
        which can be used during any step to make step-specific remarks. The contents of this
        field will not be carried over to the next step, i.e. it will be cleared for the next
        step once the current step is released. This field is only shown to members of the 
        acting group.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :due_date )-%> can be used to define
        a due date for the current step. The contents of this
        field will not be carried over to the next step, i.e. it will be cleared for the next
        step once the current step is released. This field is only shown to members of the
        acting group.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :prev_assmt )-%> is the assessment code
        by the commenting project group for the current step. This code is replaced by the
        <%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :new_assmt )-%> once the PCP Subject
        is released by the commenting project group: It is the summary assessment of the subject
        for the current step.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_status )-%> is automatically
        set to <%= help_term PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_states )[ 0 ]-%> when a
        new subject is created; after the first round - when the initial observations are
        released to the originating project group - the status changes to
        <%= help_term PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_states )[ 1 ]-%>;
        finally, the status is set to 
        <%= help_term PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :subject_states )[ 2 ]-%>
        when any of the terminal assessment states have been reached. In this final state,
        it is not possible anymore to Release the PCP Subject for further reviews.</li>

      <%= link_to t( 'pcp_subjects.show.form_title' ), '#pcp_release' -%> page. This action
      can only be performed by either the owner or the deputy of the currently responsible

    <p>The commenting project group can only release a PCP Step when a
      <%= help_term PcpStep.human_attribute_name( :new_assmt )-%> is set.</p>
    <p>The presenting project group can only release a PCP Step if a

      <%= help_term PcpSubject.human_attribute_name( :project_doc_id )-%> is given.</p>
