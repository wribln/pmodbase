    <p class="lead">Abbreviations ease the use of long, complicated words and 
      technical terms.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that abbreviations should help to read a text! Too many
    	abbreviations or unusual abbreviations make it difficult for the reader
    	to quickly comprehend the meaning of the text. Hence, try to avoid 
    	abbreviations unless it really helps to make your text easier to read.</p>
    <p>The abbreviations (including acronyms) used in the project are stored
      in the Abbreviations table of this database. In order to have a common
      appearance of specific situations, the following guidelines should
      assist you to phrase the description of the abbreviation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If an abbreviation refers to a term in a foreign language, list
        first the text of the meaning in that language, then put the name of
        that language into parentheses and include a translation of the term
        in English.<br/>
        For example:<br/>
        a.m. = ante meridien (Latin: before noon)<br/>
        GmbH = Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung (German: limited/private
        liability company)</li>
      <li>Sometimes, two abbreviations are used with the same
        meaning: In order to ensure consistency for the documents created in
        the project, the preferred abbreviation should be noted by adding
        (favoured) to the preferred one, e.g.<br/>
        RAMS = Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety<br/>
        RAMS = Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety
        (favoured)</li>
      <li>In some cases, two abbreviations are used for the same term; the
        abbreviation to be used in the project (either because it is correct
        or for other consistency reasons) should be marked with the suffix
        '(preferred: XYZ)', for example:<br/>
        MB = Megabyte<br/>
        MByte = Megabyte (preferred: MB)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The extra field <%= help_param Abbreviation.human_attribute_name( :sort_code ) -%>
      is only used for sorting the abbreviations in lists: This field is
      automatically set to the lowercase
      <%= help_param Abbreviation.human_attribute_name( :code ) -%> without
      any punctionation characters when nothing else is entered. You should
      manually fill this field if the 
      <%= help_param Abbreviation.human_attribute_name( :code ) -%>
      contains any non-standard alphabetic characters, for example Greek
      characters.</p>
