    <p class="lead">Manage Requests for Clarifications (RfCs)</p>
    <p>RfC Status Records contain meta information on Requests for Clarifications.
    RfC Documents contain the actual question and answer. The combination of both
    is managed here in the RfC Status Register.</p>
    <p>The following items are administered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :id )-%>
        is the unique identifier of each RfC in the system. This number is 
        automatically generated by the system and cannot be modified.</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :rfc_type )-%>
        defines the type of the RfC. This attribute is set when an RfC is
        created and cannot be changed later as the type also sets the
        applicable workflow.</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :title )-%>
        provides a string which can be used to give a short, significant
        summary of the RfC. This field can also be used to add (hash) tags
        to allow searches for RfCs outside of the available fields.</li>
      <li>The following fields,
        <%= help_param RfcDocument.human_attribute_name( :version  )-%>,
        <%= help_param RfcDocument.human_attribute_name( :question )-%>, 
        <%= help_param RfcDocument.human_attribute_name( :answer   )-%>, and
        <%= help_param RfcDocument.human_attribute_name( :note     )-%> are
        part of the <%= link_to_help 'rfc_documents', RfcDocument.model_name.human -%>
        related to this RfC Status Record. The 
        <%= help_term RfcDocument.human_attribute_name( :version  )-%> is
        automatically incremented whenever any of these fields are modified.</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :asking_group_id )-%>
        is the project group asking the question;</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :answering_group_id )-%>
        is the project entity responsible to provide a response to the question.</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :project_doc_id )-%>
        is a field to be used for the storage of the document id of the project-wide
        document management system. This id should not contain a version number
        as it should refer to the RfC Document independent of the current version.</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :project_rms_id )-%>
        provides space to enter a requirements identifier in respect to this
        RfC.</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :asking_group_doc_id )-%>
        can be used to store a document id as used by the asking group;</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :answering_group_doc_id  )-%>
        can be used to store a document id as used by the responding group.</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :current_status )-%>
        gives the current status of this RfC, and</li>
      <li><%= help_param RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :current_task )-%>
        provides the current task within the workflow; dummy tasks (as needed
        for internal processing) are noted in angle brackets, e.g. &lt;workflow 
        completed&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filter Functionality</h3>
      <p>For general information how to filter RfCs, see the help on 
      <%= link_to_help 'Filter' -%>.
      The filter for the current status of RfCs (column
      <%= help_term RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :current_status )-%>)
      allows you to select a specific status for each of the different types of
      RfCs. You can also select there to view all RfCs of a specific type - this
      is a duplicate function to the filter in the column
      <%= help_term RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :rfc_type )-%> and
      may be a bit confusing: If you select one type of RfC in the 
      <%= help_term RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :rfc_type )-%> column
      and another in the 
      <%= help_term RfcStatusRecord.human_attribute_name( :current_status )-%>
      column, your results will contain no records as both fields contradict.
      This behaviour is caused by the current design allowing both fields to
      filter RfCs.</p>
    <h3>Workflow Access Control</h3>
    <p>General access to this feature is controlled by the
      <%= link_to_help 'feature_access_control', 'Feature Access Control'-%>. In addition, updating
      RfCs is only permitted on a task by task basis according to the list in the
      <%= help_term Permission4Flow.model_name.human -%>, i.e. a
      user may only update RfCs when he is allowed to access that task.</p>
      <p>For <%= t( 'rfc_status_records.workflows.w00.label' )-%> and 
      <%= t( 'rfc_status_records.workflows.w01.label' )-%> RfCs, group
      access control is observed additionally, i.e. a user may only update
      records for those groups for which he has an RfC update permission.
      More specifically, for <%= t( 'rfc_status_records.workflows.w00.label' )-%>
      RfCs, a user may only update records for the clarifying group, and
      for <%= t( 'rfc_status_records.workflows.w01.label' )-%> RfCs, the
      user may only update records when he has permission for the requesting
      group.</p>

      can be found <%= link_to 'here',  rfc_workflow_info_path %>.</p>
    <h3>Statistics</h3>
      <p>The number of RfCs per Type and Status is shown on the <%= help_term t( 'general.statistics' )-%>
