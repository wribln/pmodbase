    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>An PCP Category represents the (implicit or explicit) agreement between two Project Groups
      to participate in a process where a PCP Subject (e.g. a document or a site) is presented by the
      <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%> to the 
      <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_group_id )-%> for review, comments and
      possibly final approval.</p>
    <p>PCP Categories are used to group PCP Subjects, for example, by the same originating and
      receiving project groups: All reviews of project documents by the client's organisation
      could be one PCP Category; another PCP Category would be all reviews of civil works
      documents by the systems groups; again another PCP Category would be all
      internal reviews within a specific project group.</p>
    <p>Another, important purpose for PCP Categories is the reporting aspect: Statistics are
      generated by PCP Category, and within each PCP Category, by the two participating
      project groups.</p>
    <p>The assignment of a specific PCP Category to a PCP Subject can be changed later by the
      owner of that PCP Subject - provided she has also the permission to administer PCP Categories
      for the other Project Group.</p>
    <p>The following attributes are administered per PCP Category:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :id ) -%> is the unique identifier of each 
        individual PCP Category.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :label ) -%> is the name of the PCP Category.
        The link here will lead to all PCP Subjects within this PCP Category.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id ) -%> is the project group
        presenting the PCP Subjects to be reviewed and commented on. This is group also provides the
        responses to any observations and comments.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )-%> is the principal contact
        of the PCP for the <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%>. This
        user (account) has the permission to add PCP Subjects to this PCP Category.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_deputy_id )-%> can be used to define a
        default deputy for the <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )-%>.
        Note: This account is not required to be a member of the
        <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%>! You can choose any
        existing account from any project group to act as deputy or proxy for this PCP Category.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_group_id ) -%> is the project group
        providing comments and observations on the PCP Subjects in this PCP Category.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_owner_id )-%> is the default owner for
        the <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_group_id )-%> for any new PCP Subjects
        in this PCP Category. This parameter is required to ensure that there is always an owner defined
        for any PCP Subject.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_deputy_id )-%> can be used to define a
        default deputy or proxy for the <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_owner_id )-%>.
        Note: This account is not required to be a member of the
        <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :c_group_id )-%>! You can choose any
        existing account from any project group to act as deputy or proxy for this PCP Category.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :description )-%> can be used to
        add some comments on this specific category, possibly some handling notes or references
        to more details on the process as agreed with the project partners involved in this type
        of PCP.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Permissions and Access</h3>
    <p>All users may view the information on each PCP Category. Only users with the specific
      permission to add and edit PCP Category items may create and modify PCP Category attributes.</p>
    <p>Users who want to create PCP Subjects for a specific PCP Category, need explicit update
      permission for this PCP Category's <%= help_term PcpCategory.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%>
      in order to do so.</p>
