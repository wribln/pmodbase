    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>A single PCP Item describes an observation found during a review cycle which needs 
      clarification or resolution. PCP Items can only be added by the Commenting Group;
      comments can be added later by both the Presenting and the Commenting Group.</p>
    <p>The following attributes are administered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param PcpItem.human_attribute_name( :seqno )-%> is a unique number
        created for each PCP Item for a specific PCP Subject. This number is computed
        automatically by the system and cannot be modified. If PCP Items are removed,
        this number does not change so it can be used as unique identifier.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpItem.human_attribute_name( :reference )-%> is a text field
        to be used to describe the location of the problem. In documents, this would be
        a chapter or a page number.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpItem.human_attribute_name( :description )-%> holds details
        on the observation.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpItem.human_attribute_name( :item_assmnt )-%> reflects the
        status of this PCP Item. It is derived from the
        <%= help_term PcpItem.human_attribute_name( :assessment )-%> of the initial
        observation, or from the most recent
        <%= help_term PcpComment.human_attribute_name( :assessment )-%> as given by
        the Commenting Group.</li>
      <li>The current <%= help_param PcpItem.human_attribute_name( :pcp_step_id )-%> is shown
        for information as <%= help_term t( 'pcp_items.pcp_step' )%>.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param PcpItem.human_attribute_name( :author )-%> is set to the user
        (account) who created this PCP Item or Comment.</li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpItem.human_attribute_name( :assessment )-%> is the evaluation of
      the current PCP Item by the Commenting Group. This assessment is set with the creation
      of an PCP Item or when adding a comment to a response by the Presenting Group.<br/>
      The possible values are:
      <ul>
        <li><%= help_term PcpItem::ASSESSMENT_LABELS[ 0 ]-%> should be used for issues with minimal
        impact such as clarifications, questions, spelling or obvious drawing errors, obviously
        wrong labels, etc. If a document or drawing contains only issues of this class, it
        could be categorized as <%= help_term PcpStep::ASSESSMENT_LABELS[ 2 ]-%>.</li>
        <li><%= help_term  PcpItem::ASSESSMENT_LABELS[ 1 ]-%> are those issues requiring rework
          on the PCP Subject before it can be approved. Any PCP Item with this assessment normally
          leads to an overall PCP Subject assessment of <%= help_term PcpStep::ASSESSMENT_LABELS[ 3 ]-%>.
          </li>
        <li><%= help_term PcpItem::ASSESSMENT_LABELS[ 2 ]-%> indicates that the issue
          is resolved and the PCP Item can be considered as closed, i.e. no further comments
          are required or possible. When all PCP Items of a PCP Subject have this status, then this 
          PCP Subject can be set to <%= help_term PcpStep::ASSESSMENT_LABELS[ 1 ]-%>.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><%= help_param PcpComment.human_attribute_name( :is_public )-%> can be set by the
      owner or deputy of the respective PCP Subject on comments. Only comments where this flag
      is set, are listed on Release reports and are visible to anyone. Comments where this flag
      is clear, are only visible to the group responsible for the current PCP Step.<br/>
      For any release, at least one comment on the current PCP Step must have this flag set.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Error Messages</h3>
    <p>"<%= t( 'pcp_comments.msg.pcp_subject_ref' )%>" is reported when the PCP Subject referenced
    by the PCP Item is not the same as the PCP Subject referenced by the related PCP Step. Normally,
    this error should not occur as this information is set internally. However, in rare instances,
    this message might occur and can only be fixed by a direct change to the database.</p>
