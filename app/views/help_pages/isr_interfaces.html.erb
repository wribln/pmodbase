    <p class="lead">Manage Interfaces within the Interface Status Register (ISR)</p>
    <p>This help text contains information on the handling of the top-level <strong>Interface</strong> (IF)
    information within the ISR. Information on <strong>Interface Agreement</strong> (IA) attributes can be
    found <%= link_to_help :isr_agreements, 'here' %>; for a general introduction about the 
    Interface Status Register (ISR) see <%= link_to_help :isr_general, 'here' %>.
    <h3>Interfaces</h3>
    <p>&quot;Interfaces are considered as the boundaries between independent but interacting systems,
    organizations, stakeholders, project phases and scopes, and construction elements.&quot;</p>
    <h3>IF Attributes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :code ) -%> is the unique identifier
      of an IF. It has the format
      <strong>IF&ndash;</strong>&lt;n&gt;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&lt;IFL&gt;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&lt;IFP&gt;
      where &lt;n&gt; is a unique, generated number,
      &lt;IFL&gt; is the group code of the leading project group (the 'Interface Leader' or
      <%= help_term IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :l_group_id)-%>), and
      &lt;IFP&gt; is the group code of the partner project group (the 'Interface Partner' or
      <%= help_term IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%>).</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :l_group_id )-%> is the group code
      of the IFL. This group is responsible to resolve the documented interface.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :p_group_id )-%> is the group code
      of the IFP. This group is responsible to provide support to resolve any issues related to
      the specified IF.</li>
      <li>Note: An actual IA may later be agreed between different parties,
      for example sub-lots or sub-contractors. The groups defined here identify the major
      parties which require an interface clarification and resolution process for this project.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :title )-%> provides a short
      topic of the IF. This text is displayed as header on all listings regarding this
      IF together with the IF code.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :desc )-%> contains an elaboration
      of the respective IF. This text can be up to 255 characters long.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :safety_related )-%> is a flag
      which must be marked when this IF is related to any safety requirements.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :if_level )-%> groups IFs into
      the following categories:<br/>
      	<%= help_term IsrInterface::ISR_IF_LEVEL_LABELS[ 0 ]-%> could be considered a low-risk IF;<br/>
      	<%= help_term IsrInterface::ISR_IF_LEVEL_LABELS[ 1 ]-%> are all standard IFs;<br/>
      	<%= help_term IsrInterface::ISR_IF_LEVEL_LABELS[ 2 ]-%> are high-risk IFs requiring 
        management attention and should therefore be tracked in the project schedule as they
        are important for the progress of the project.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :cfr_record_id )-%> allows the specification
      of a Central File Register (CFR) record linking to a single document or a set of documents 
      containing information on this IF. On input, you will need to enter the numerical
      <%= help_term t( 'isr_interfaces.form_if.cfr_record_id' )-%>. The button next to the input field
      labelled <%= help_term t( 'isr_interfaces.form_if.cfr_record_link' )-%> leads to the listing
      of all CFR records.</li>
      <li><%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :if_status )-%> shows the current status
      of the IF:<br/>
      	<%= help_term IsrInterface::ISR_IF_STATUS_LABELS[ 0 ]-%> is the initial status of an
        IF and is set automatically when an IF is created.<br/>
        <%= help_term IsrInterface::ISR_IF_STATUS_LABELS[ 1 ]-%> is an intermediate status which
        can be set by the IFM for statistical purposes once the documentation on the IF
        is complete, i.e the IF is named and described sufficiently, and IFL and IFP are
        appointed.<br/>
        <%= help_term IsrInterface::ISR_IF_STATUS_LABELS[ 2 ]-%> is a status set automatically
        once the first IA is released by the IFL for confirmation by the IFP. This will 
        prohibit any changes to the IF attributes once the IF is agreed.<br/>
        <%= help_term IsrInterface::ISR_IF_STATUS_LABELS[ 3 ]-%> are IFs which were identified
        at some point in time but later found to be not applicable to the project.<br/>
        <%= help_term IsrInterface::ISR_IF_STATUS_LABELS[ 4 ]-%> is similar to the previous
        status but is set when an IF was defined but later found to be not required for the
        project. All related, open IAs will be terminated as well. This status is set automatically
        when the withdrawal of an IF is requested.</li>
      <li>The <%= help_param IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :note )-%> field can be used at
      any time (i.e. regardless of the status of the IF) to comment on the status of the IF. This
      field is not part of the IF definition and must thus not contain any contractual
      relevant information.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filter</h3>
    <p>The first line of the filter attributes refer to the IF attributes, the second line to
    the IA attributes.</p>
    <p>In the <%= help_term IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :code )%> column, the first field
    will filter for a specific IF number (all IF numbers are unique hence any IF can be found by
    this number alone).</p>
    <p>The second field in the <%= help_term IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :code )%> column
    will search for a project group - either as IFL or as IFP.</p>
    <p>The search field in the <%= help_term t( 'isr_interfaces.index.if_title' )%> column will search for
    the given string in both the <%= help_term IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :title )%> and
    <%= help_term IsrInterface.human_attribute_name( :desc )%> attributes.</p>
    <h3>Permissions</h3>
    <p>Any user can view the ISR index page and details on IFs and IAs. Only the IFM should be
    able to add new IFs and IAs, update and withdraw IFs. For these actions, the required 
    permission level 2 must be set.</p>
    <p>IFL and IFP are set within an IA as <%= help_term IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :l_owner_id )%>
    and <%= help_term IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :p_owner_id )%> respectively. For each group,
    a deputy can be defined as <%= help_term IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :l_deputy_id )%> and
    <%= help_term IsrAgreement.human_attribute_name( :p_deputy_id )%> respectively. All users acting as
    IFL and IFP must have a permission level 1 for this feature.</p>
    <p>In addition, the IFL should be given access to the <%= help_term TiaList.model_name.human %> feature
    so he can manage the IA related resolution and validation steps.</p>
    <h3>Remarks on Actions</h3>
    <p>The index page '<%= t( 'isr_interfaces.index.form_title' )%>' lists all IFs and associated,
    active IAs in alphabetical order of (1) IFL and (2) IFP.</p>
    <p>Viewing an individual IF (via 'Q' under Action on a line showing an IF) will display a short
    version*) of this IF including all associated, active IAs.</p>
    <p>Viewing an individual IA (via 'Q' under Action on a line showing an IA) will display a short
    version*) of this IA including the related IF information. This IA display contains a button
    <%= help_term t( 'button_label.print')-%> which produces a printable view with the heading
    '<%= t( 'isr_interfaces.show_ia_icf.main_heading' )%>'. The links on the top of this page
    <%= help_term t( 'button_label.print' )%>
    <%= help_term t( 'button_label.show' )%>
    <%= help_term t( 'button_label.index' )%> will not be printed.</p>
    <p><%= help_term t( 'button_label.print' )%> opens the operating system print dialog,<br/>
    <%= help_term t( 'button_label.show' )%> goes back to the original short view*), and<br/>
    <%= help_term t( 'button_label.index' )%> opens the index page again.</p>
    <p>*) These short views contain links to the related IF and IAs, respectively.</p>
    <p>The <%= help_term t( 'button_label.all' )%> on an IF or IA view re-opens the information
    in a format with fields similar to the edit view: For an IF, only the IF-related attributes
    will be shown, for an IA, the IA-attributes and the attributes of the related IF will be
    shown.</p>
