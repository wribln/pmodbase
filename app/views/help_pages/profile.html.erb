    <h3>Personal Data</h3>
    <p>The following personal data can be updated by you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param Person.human_attribute_name( :formal_name ) -%> is
        the name which you prefer to be called in formal situations or by
        persons your are not on a first name basis with. This is normally your 
        full name, prefixed with your title, for example: <em>Christian Q. Sample</em>,
        or <em>Dr. Jos&eacute; Eduardo Santos Tavares Melo Silva</em>, or
        <em>Ms Yao Ming</em>. Your formal name should enable all others to correctly
        address you in any official communication matters.</li>
      <li><%= help_param Person.human_attribute_name( :informal_name ) -%>
        could be your first name, your nickname or moniker - the name, people
        would use in the project to address you on informal occasions.
        The <%= Person.human_attribute_name( :informal_name ) -%> is also used
        as salutation on this site, or in e-mails to you generated by this
        site. The examples above could have the following informal names:
        <em>Chris</em>, <em>Joe</em>, <em>Fred</em>.</li>
      <li><%= help_param Person.human_attribute_name( :email ) -%> is your
        official e-mail address to be used for communication on project
        matters. This would normally be your company e-mail address, and not
        your private e-mail address. Your e-mail address must be unique within
        the pmodbase application as this e-mail address is used to ensure that each
        person is entered only once into the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><%= t( 'people.account_heading' ) -%></h3>
    <p>Regarding access to your account, the following attributes can be changed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can choose another <%= help_param Account.human_attribute_name( :name ) -%>,
        this must be at least 3 characters long; this is the name you use when signing on
        to this system.</li>
      <li>If you want to change your <%= help_param Account.human_attribute_name( :password ) -%>,
        you must choose one which is at least 8 characters long, contains at least one digit, one lower- and one uppercase alphabetic character, and one other printable ASCII character.</li>
      <li>You need to repeat the <%= help_param Account.human_attribute_name( :password ) -%> in
        the <%= help_param Account.human_attribute_name( :password_confirmation ) -%> field to
        ensure your correct spelling.</li>
      <li>If you select <%= help_param Account.human_attribute_name( :keep_base_open )-%>,
        the selection of a feature will cause that feature to open a new window while the
        base page remains open. This may be useful for the experienced user who may want
        to keep several feature windows open at the same time without referring to browser-specific
        handling. When this option is selected, the breadcrumb navigation will not be
        displayed as well.<br/>Note: <strong>This change will only take effect after the next
        sign-on!</strong></li>
    </ul> 
    <h3><%= t( 'people.ci_heading' ) -%></h3>
    <p>Contact Information is configured by the responsible person who created your profile,
    this is normally your group manager. If any Contact Information is listed, you can
    change the data here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= help_param ContactInfo.human_attribute_name( :info_type ) -%>
        describes the location to which the following information applies to, e.g.
        'Company' (for home office), or 'Project' (for the office at the
        project's location). You cannot change this field and you cannot add
        any further information records here: If you want to specify contact
        information for another location, contact you group manager, or another
        person which can add another contact information record to your personal
        data.</li>
      <li><%= help_param ContactInfo.human_attribute_name( :phone_no_fixed ) -%>
        is reserved for your fixed-line phone number, and</li>
      <li><%= help_param ContactInfo.human_attribute_name( :phone_no_mobile ) -%>
        for the telephone number of your mobile phone.<br/>
        Each phone number should be complete with the respective country code
        prefixed by a '+', for example '+49' would be the prefix for a telephone
        number in Germany.</li>
      <li>Use the <%= help_param ContactInfo.human_attribute_name( :department ) -%>
        field to specify the department to which you belong to at the given location.</li>
      <li><%= help_param ContactInfo.human_attribute_name( :detail_location ) -%>
        can be used to specify any other information enabling a visitor to locate you
        (building, room number, cubicle id, mail stop id, etc.).
      <li><%= help_param ContactInfo.human_attribute_name( :address_id ) -%>
        can be used to link an address to this contact information record.</li>
    </ul>
